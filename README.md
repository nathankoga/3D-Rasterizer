# 3D-Rasterizer

This project implements a rasterizer in C from scratch that is capable of rendering 3D images from any arbitrary camera position using a scanline algorithm. Utilizing the Phong-shading model, Z-buffering, and linear interpolation, this program is capable of displaying objects with realistic lighting, depth, and color. 

To use this program, the "ws_tris.txt" file that stores triangle data (inlcuding cartesian coordinates, colors, and normal vectors for each vertex) and outputs a pnm file of the resulting image.

The resulting video stitches together 1000 images of different camera angles into a movie that which be viewed at this link:
